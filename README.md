# 🚀 Project Overview

PharmaGuard is a modular AI-powered pharmacogenomics clinical decision support system that:

- **Parses patient VCF genomic files** locally and via specialized APIs.
- **Detects clinically relevant variants** across major pharmacogenes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, etc.).
- **Infers star alleles & diplotypes** using a high-precision internal matching engine.
- **Assigns metabolizer phenotypes** (PM, IM, NM, RM, URM) aligned with CPIC standards.
- **Applies drug–gene clinical rules** to generate actionable recommendations.
- **Generates structured EHR-ready JSON** for seamless integration into medical records.
- **Produces multilingual AI explanations** (English & 6 Indian languages supported).

It bridges the gap between **Complex Genomics** → **Clinical Logic** → **Explainable AI** → **Real-World Patient Care**.

# 🌟 What Makes PharmaGuard Different

- **Structured EHR-Ready Outputs**: Standardized JSON response for direct clinical software ingestion.
- **Hybrid Explanation Engine**: Uses external LLMs (Gemini/OpenAI) for rich summaries with an internal rule-based engine fallback for 100% reliability.
- **Transparent Confidence Engine**: Attaches detailed scoring to every risk assessment based on variant coverage.
- **Micro-multilingual Support**: First-class support for localized clinical insights in major Indian languages.
- **Privacy-First Parsing**: Separation of raw genomic data parsing from the clinical interpretation pipeline.

# 🏗 Architecture Overview

PharmaGuard follows a deterministic, modular pipeline to ensure medical auditability:

1. **User Upload**: Secure VCF file or text-based drug name input.
2. **VCF Validation**: Structural and checksum validation of genomic data.
3. **VCF Parser**: Local extraction of relevant rsIDs and genotypes.
4. **Star Allele Engine**: Mapping of genotypes to standard pharmacogenomic nomenclature.
5. **Phenotype Assignor**: Inference of the patient's metabolic state.
6. **Clinical Rule Engine**: Application of drug-specific recommendations (Adjust Dosage, Contraindicated, etc.).
7. **Confidence Measurer**: Scoring output based on data completeness.
8. **LLM Enrichment**: Contextual summary generation for both Clinicians and Patients.
9. **Final clinical JSON**: Consolidated, ready-to-use medical report.

# 📊 Confidence Scoring Logic

PharmaGuard provides a **Confidence Score** (Base = 1.0) for every result:
- **Missing Variant**: `-0.1` per required rsID not found in VCF.
- **Indeterminate Phenotype**: `-0.2` if alleles don't map to a standard CPIC phenotype.
- **Partial Allele Detection**: `-0.15` for ambiguous genotypes.

*Final score is clamped between 0 and 1.*

# 🌏 Supported Languages

- **English** (en-US)
- **Hindi** (hi-IN)
- **Bengali** (bn-IN)
- **Tamil** (ta-IN)
- **Telugu** (te-IN)
- **Marathi** (mr-IN)
- **Gujarati** (gu-IN)

*Note: Clinical terms and gene symbols remain internationalized for medical precision.*
